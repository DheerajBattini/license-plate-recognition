# 🚗 License Plate Recognition (LPR)
**By Dheeraj Battini**

This project detects and recognizes license plates from vehicle images using YOLOv5 for object detection and Tesseract OCR for character recognition.

---

## 📌 Objective
- Detect license plates from car images using bounding box object detection.
- Recognize and extract the alphanumeric text from those plates using OCR.
- Generate a submission CSV of predictions.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset includes:
- 900 training vehicle images with annotated bounding boxes
- 900 license plate cropped images with text labels
- 201 test vehicle images (your model runs on these)

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **YOLOv5 (v7.0)** – For object detection of license plates  
- **Tesseract OCR** – For reading license plate text  
- **Python** – For image processing and automation  
- **OpenCV, Pandas** – Supporting libraries
